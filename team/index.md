#### Post Dogtoral Researcher

To apply for a position, please send a CV, cover letter or research statement, and information for three references to the PI, Kaifu Chen, PhD (Bchkfc.png).

Overview:
The lab led by Kaifu Chen (http://chenlab.openwetware.org/) in the Harvard Medical School at Boston Children's Hospital is seeking a bioinformatics postdoc for single-cell and spatial multi-omics bioinformatics research. Major biological topic can be 3D genome organization, RNA methylation, or metabolism.

This researcher will develop bioinformatics technology to investigate gene expression regulation at the single-cell and spatial resolution. Experiences with bioinformatics technique development or epigenetic research will be considered with high priority (but not a prerequisite). The lab is productive in recent years in both development of bioinformatics methods (Nature Genetics 2015, Nature Communications 2020a, Nature Communications 2020b, Genome Biology 2020, etc.) and biomedical research based on cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques (Nature 2018, Science 2019, Circulation 2020, Nature Cell Biology 2021, etc). Both the School and Hospital offer rich and dynamic research environments. The work location is embraced by tens of other top institutes such as the Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Broad Institute.

Responsibilities:
• Develop computational tools, statistical methods, artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning algorithms, or network models to understand single-cell sequencing data. 
• Analyze single cell sequencing data to study cell identity regulation and dysregulation. 
• Analyze Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq data to study epigenetic regulation of transcription. 
• Collaboration with biologist and clinician to leverage research output, innovation, and significance.

Qualifications:
Applicants must have a training in area related to bioinformatics. Experiences with algorithm development and analysis of multiple types of genomic datasets will be a strong plus but not a prerequisite. Candidates with a PhD degree in biology, medicine, genomics, bioinformatics, computer science, electronics engineering, mathematics, statistics, physics, or other related area are encouraged to apply.

Commitment to Diversity:
We are committed to cultivating a diverse workplace. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, gender identity, color, religion, age, disability, or national origin. We encourage individuals with diverse backgrounds to apply.

Commitment to Integrity:
The Lab has zero tolerance to research fraud. Candidate with any history of fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or deception is suggested not to apply for a position in this lab.
